## #StandWithSCPRU

The SCP Foundation Russian Branch has been operating off of Wikidot for the majority of its existence; however, the numerous technical difficulties related to the platform, as well as issues with receiving feedback, have long since prompted us to search for more stable solutions - or develop our own.
Said development of a newer Wikidot-like platform has already been in the books in the recent months, fuelled by spare-time efforts of our technical staff. Unfortunately, recent events prompt us to accelerate them - to enable migration as quickly as feasible.

As such, we, the Russian Branch staff, are opening [a fundraiser](https://boosty.to/scpfanpage) to reimburse and promote the efforts of those working on this project.
